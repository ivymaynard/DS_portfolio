## Technical Skills
- Proficient in R, R Studio, and Python.
- Experience working with statistical modeling, with specific focus in linear and logistic regression, in order to predict outcomes and make decisons.
- Can manipulate large untidy datasets into workable datasets which are optimal for analysis and exploration.
- Strong foundation in Calculus, Multivariable Calculus, and Linear Algebra.

## Purpose
This website is a collection of some of my data science work used to showcase my learning in data collecting, tidying, exploring, and analysis. I have selected various baseball players and teams of interest to me and started to answer questions about them through these strategies so that I can become more familiar with the world of sabremetrics.

## Projects

**Mini Project 1: Data Visualization**

*The 2018 Boston Red Sox and their Infamous Outfield: Were they the Ticket to Victory?*

This project looks at the 2018 MLB World Series matchup and explores errors commited by the Red Sox and the Dodgers to see if the total regular season errors alligns with the outcome of the playoffs. I looked at team-wide errors as well as individual errors to explore any unusual patterns in the data and to contextualize preconceived notions with the statistics.

**Mini Project 2: A Data Wrangling tutorial**

*Tanner Houck and Garrett Crochet: Battle of the Aces*

This project explores the differences between 2024 starts for Crochet and Houck, the two most highly anticipated strating pitchers for the 2025 Red Sox. I modled various tidying functions using the tidyverse to simplify and explore various parts of these pitchers profiles, such as performace at home vs away and innings pitched per start.
